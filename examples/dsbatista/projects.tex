		  \item{An award-winning project (2nd place, "Arquivo.pt Awards 2021") extracts political interactions from Portuguese news headlines. It uses supervised models to detect these interactions, linking the involved politicians to Wikidata to create an RDF semantic graph. The graph can queried through a SPARQL endpoint or explored interactively through the website interface. I developed it during the 2020 pandemic while on short-time work, bringing to life an idea conceived during my Ph.D. studies. - \url{https://www.politiquices.pt}}

		\item {\texttt{breds} is an open-source Python package stemming from my Ph.D. thesis, designed to extract named-entity relationships without labeled data. It utilizes an initial seed pairs of named-entities to learn extraction patterns, expanding and generalising relationships through distributional semantics while minimising semantic drift. - \url{https://pypi.org/project/breds}}

     	\item {\texttt{nervaluate} is an open-source Python package that evaluates named-entity recognition systems, including partial entity matching. It began as a proof-of-concept I worked on during my time at Comtravo and has since evolved into a mature Python package with contributions from various collaborators. - \url{https://pypi.org/project/nervaluate}}
