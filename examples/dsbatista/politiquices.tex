        \item {A tool to explore political interactions of support and opposition, based on news articles from the past 25 years, awarded the \textbf{2nd place on the "Arquivo.pt Awards 2021"} organised by the Portuguese Web Archive.}
		\item {Using an API, I crawled news headlines mentioning politicians from archived newspapers websites, annotated a sample in order to build supervised models to detect relationships between politicians and to link them to Wikidata.}
		\item {By applying the trained models to the crawled data, I was able to generate a semantic graph connecting Wikidata politicians entries through a support or opposition relationship sustained by archived news articles.}
		\item {Using a SPARQL endpoint it's possible to ask: \textit{Which politicians affiliated with party X opposed/supported politicians from party Y?}}
		\item {The project gained the interest of journalists, political scientists and social humanities researchers.}
